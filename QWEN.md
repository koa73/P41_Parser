# P41 Parser Project

## Project Overview
This is a Python project named "P41_Parser" created as a PyCharm project. The project appears to be in early development stages and is focused on parsing functionality, possibly related to network architecture or technical documentation based on the data files present.

The project contains:
- A basic `main.py` file with a simple "Hello PyCharm" function
- Empty `config` directory for configuration files
- `data` directory containing draw.io diagram files related to "Р41" network architecture
- A Python virtual environment (`.venv`)
- Standard PyCharm project configuration files (`.idea` directory)

```

## Building and Running
Currently, the project has a basic Python script that can be run directly:
```bash
python main.py
```

Since the project is in early stages, there are no specific build scripts, requirements files, or testing configurations defined yet.

## Development Conventions
- The project uses Python 3.10.12 as indicated by the virtual environment configuration
- Standard PyCharm IDE is being used for development
- The naming suggests this parser is related to "Р41" (possibly a project code or specification)

## Next Steps
To develop this project further, consider:
1. Adding a `requirements.txt` file to manage dependencies
2. Creating a proper configuration system in the `config` directory
3. Implementing the actual parsing functionality in `main.py`
4. Adding unit tests and documentation
5. Defining clear project goals and specifications based on the network architecture diagrams in the data directory
